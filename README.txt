How to run:
1) open MIMU_sim.mat
2) edit settings.mat to change parameters and IMU noise characteristics
3) if you want to change the IMU configuration or number of IMU, see comments in MIMU_sim.mat.
The code is set up to take any number of IMU in any arbitrary configuration
4) run the code. It takes a while to run.
